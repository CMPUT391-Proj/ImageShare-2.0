The goal of this project is to develop a web-based database application system that provides service to its clients for storing, sharing, and searching their photos.  

In particular, it is capable of:
- uploading and storing photos
- entering and updating the descriptive information for photos
- specifying access priviledges for friends and/or public to share your photos
- searching for photos with given words and/or other specified conditions
- generating and displaying a data analysis report.
